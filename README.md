# Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack

This repository contains the implementation of the _Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack (ASMA)_, a targeted adversarial example generation method for deep learning segmentation models. This attack was proposed in the paper "_Impact of Adversarial Examples on Deep Learning Models for Biomedical Image Segmentation._" by _U. Ozbulak et al._ published in the 22nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI-2019. ([Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13124))

## General Information
This repository is organized as follows:
* **Code** - *src/* folder contains necessary python files to perform the attack and calculate various stats (i.e., correctness and modification)

* **Data** - *data/* folder contains a couple of examples for testing purposes. The data we used in this study can be taken from [1].
  
* **Model** - Example model used in this repository can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ziz7s070kkaexp/eye_pretrained_model.pt . _helper_functions.py_ contains a function to load this file and _main.py_ contains an exaple that uses this model.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* How can I run the demo? 

  **1-** Download the model from https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ziz7s070kkaexp/eye_pretrained_model.pt
  
  **2-** Create a folder called _model_ on the same level as _data_ and _src_, put the model under this (_model_) folder.
  
  **3-** Run _main.py_.

* Would this attack work in multi-class segmentation models?

  Yes, given that you provide a proper target mask, model etc.
  
* Does the code require any modifications in order to make it work for multi-class segmentation models?

  No (probably, depending on your model/input). At least the attack itself (adaptive_attack.py) should not require major modifications on its logic.
